ESC generated AC waveform's polarity doesn’t reverse so it’s not actual AC.

How to increase flight time with the same motor: reduce pitch and diameter till power is below threshold

Hall effect sensor can be used to wirelessly measure current

High KV means more speed and lesser torque, less thrust and vice versa

Thrust power ratio efficiency ratio: grams/Watt
Power is mechanical power/electric power
Thrust measured which unit: grams

The pitch of a propeller is the distance moved by the fixed wing plane in one rotation of the propeller.

Torque inversely proportional to rpm
Throttle up, ESC amplitude up, ESC detects
Phase shift due to higher back EMF as
backEMF \* KV = RPM
So frequency increased to fix the phase shift
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/262106/why-do-brushless-motors-have-a-kv-rating

motor current = (E - back) / R
Kv rating: rpm per volt, eg 1000kv given 11V will spin at 11000 rpm

2.4 GHz is special because: FCC regulations make it ISM band: industrial, scientific and medical, no license required to operate on them
They don’t clash with other license requiring bands such as 1.9 GHz which is used for cellular communications
Cheap chips
They are a balance between penetration power through walls (antenna size, wavelength), and bandwidth, latency ie higher data carrying capacity (5.8Ghz)

Radio control Tx protocol: depends on manufacturer eg Flysky has AFHDS, ACCST Frysky, DSM Spectrum
5th channel use: arm, fight mode

sBus iBus are serial, digital protocols, alternatives to PPM, have better latency, up to 16 channels, iBus is superior and non inverted, sBus is inverted

UART, SPI are full duplex, serial (digital) protocols; I2c is half-duplex
